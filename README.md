Airline Management System Console Application
This is a console application written in C# that serves as an airline management system. It utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and ADO.NET to connect to a database backend. This README provides an overview of the system architecture, how to set up the project, and basic usage instructions.

Features
Object-Oriented Design: The system is designed using OOP principles, with classes representing entities such as flights, passengers, airports, and tickets. Each class encapsulates its data and behavior, promoting code maintainability and reusability.

Database Integration with ADO.NET: ADO.NET is used to connect to the backend database, execute SQL queries, and retrieve or update data. The System.Data.SqlClient namespace is utilized for database interaction, enabling seamless communication between the application and the database.

Basic Functionality
Booking flights
Canceling tickets
Checking flight availability
Viewing flight details
Managing passenger information
Database Setup
Before running the application, ensure that you have set up the database. You can use any relational database management system (RDBMS) such as SQL Server, MySQL, or SQLite. The database schema should include tables for flights, passengers, airports, tickets, etc.
